                    <h2>Summary of Cybersecurity</h2>
                    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice involved with securing electronic devices, networks, and sensitive
                        information from
                        unauthorized access,theft, or use. In an ever increasing digital world the environment for cyber
                        crime
                        to happen is
                        constantly changing and evolving. Because there is a constant threat of evolving vulnerabilities
                        and
                        methods of attack,
                        we as computer scientists must create a strong defense against this unknown. Many of these
                        crimes are
                        targeted at
                        government agencies, financial institutions, large corporations, and critical infrastructure.
                        Some
                        recent cybersecurity
                        attacks in the form of data breaches have endangered millions of people to identity theft and
                        other
                        fraudulent activity.
                        These kinds of events highlight the need for strong cybersecurity measures against any unknown
                        attacker.
                        As seen in
                        class, the goal of contemporary cybersecurity is to find innovative solutions that will ensure
                        confidentiality,
                        integrity, and availability of critical information systems and infrastructure.</p>

                    <h2>Brief History of Cybersecurity, and its Advancements</h2>
                    <p>Although cybersecurity is a recent development in response to the incredible pace that technology
                        has
                        been integrating
                        into our daily lives, cybersecurity concepts are ingrained in our history as a means of
                        protecting and
                        ensuring the
                        validity of critical information. This can be seen as early as the first century with encryption
                        techniques such as the
                        Caesar cipher or Steganography. These early methods for securing classified information marks
                        the roots
                        of cybersecurity
                        principles present currently in our interconnected society. As the advancement of the personal
                        computer
                        became more
                        prevalent and with it the development of a large scale interconnected network that we know today
                        as “The
                        Internet” new
                        cybersecurity challenges arose. New threats of individual attacks on information systems and
                        network
                        attacks, shifted
                        focus to ensuring not only confidentiality of information but also integrity and proper
                        availability of
                        the information
                        for authorized users. Today cybersecurity principles cover a wide range of mechanisms to ensure
                        full
                        coverage and tiered
                        levels of protection for critical information and infrastructure that we need in order for
                        society to
                        function.</p>

                                vulnerability or flaw in software that is unknown
                                to the software vendor or cybersecurity experts. These vulnerabilities can be exploited
                                to gain unauthorized access to
                                sensitive information, install malware or other malicious software, or cause other
                                damage to computer systems and
                                networks. Zero-day exploits are particularly dangerous because they are often used by
                                sophisticated cyber criminals or
                                state-sponsored hackers, who use them to target high-value targets. Because these

            <h2>Examples of Cybersecurity Attacks</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Phishing: This involves the use of fraudulent emails or websites to trick individuals into providing
                    sensitive
                    information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers.</li>
                <li>Malware: Malware refers to malicious software that is designed to harm or compromise computer
                    systems. Examples include
                    viruses, worms, and trojans.</li>
                <li>Ransomware: This is a type of malware that encrypts files or computer systems and demands payment in
                    exchange for the
                    decryption key.</li>
                <li>Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: These involve overwhelming a network or server with traffic to make
                    it unavailable to
                    users</li>
                <li>Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: This type of attack involves intercepting communications between
                    two parties to steal
                    information or alter the contents of the message.</li>
                <li>SQL injection: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in a website or application to gain
                    unauthorized access to
                    sensitive information stored in a database.</li>
                <li>Social engineering: This is a technique used to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive
                    information, such as
                    passwords or other credentials.</li>
                <li>Advanced persistent threats (APTs): These are sophisticated and targeted attacks that are typically
                    carried out by
                    state-sponsored or organized criminal groups over a long period of time.</li>

        <div class="WhyOS" id="section-5">
            <h2>Why Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>Operating systems serve as the foundation of any computer system. It is the interface between the
                hardware and software
                components of a computer system and is responsible for scheduling, execution, and control flow of
                processes as well as
                access control. This makes targeting the operating system a very attractive target. By exploiting the
                operating system
                cyber attackers can gain access to confidential information, install and execute malicious software, and
                overall wreck
                havoc on a computer system. Compromised operating systems also provide a strong foothold in a widespread
                network attack
                by providing an authenticated entry into an otherwise secure network. These attacks, if successful, can
                be severe and
                debilitating to the victim. A successful attack can result in financial loss (ransom/ransomware), loss
                of confidential
                data (malware/virus), and reputational damage arising from system crashes and operation downtimes.</p>

            <h2>Examples of Real World Cybersecurity attacks/vulnerabilities</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Equifax Data Breach:</strong> In a 2017 attack, hackers were able to exploit a vulnerable
                    web portal
                    application for Equifax, a
                    credit reporting agency, and do an SQL injection attack to gain unauthorized access to the
                    underlying client database.
                    This vulnerability in the web portal was allegedly left unpatched by Equifax which ultimately led to
                    the security breach
                    of the client user database. This data breach gave hackers access to personally identifying data
                    from hundreds of
                    millions of people. They were also able to pull this data out of the network in an encrypted form
                    because Equifax failed
                    to renew an encryption certificate on one of their internal security tools. This data breach
                    resulted in loss of
                    critical consumer data, endangering many to the threat of identity theft as well as financial loss
                    to Equifax which had
                    to pay out its victims from a $425 million dollar consumer restitution fund.</li>
                <li><strong>Yahoo Data Breach:</strong> In a 2013 attack, 3 billion yahoo accounts were breached in one
                    of the biggest breaches of a
                    company’s network. Vulnerabilities in Yahoo’s security hackers were able to access account
                    information including names,
                    email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, and passwords. Fortunately, credit card information and
                    bank account data
                    was not compromised. The hackers were believed to be associated with the Russian government and were
                    able to gain access
                    to Yahoo’s user database by using a zero-day exploit. Yahoo’s password hashing algorithms had
                    vulnerabilities unaware to
                    the software engineers that the hackers used. Yahoo faced harsh criticism regarding its failure to
                    protect user data and
                    their response to the security breach.</li>
                <li><strong>WannaCry Ransomware Attack:</strong> In a 2017 attack, an estimated 230,000 computers across
                    150 countries were hit with a
                    ransomware attack. This attack encrypted Windows computers around the world and demanded ransoms of
                    several hundred
                    dollars from each victim for decryption. This attack utilized a worm component of malware that led
                    to its large scale
                    range by allowing the malware to self propagate without a host file. Its main avenue for attack was
                    an operating system
                    vulnerability which exploited the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The SMB protocol is a network
                    file sharing
                    protocol allowing for read/write access from server programs on a network. Although this
                    vulnerability was patched by
                    Windows many users fail to update their versions of Windows and are still victims of SMB protocol
                    exploits to this day.</li>
                <li><strong>Stuxnet:</strong> Stuxnet is a malware computer worm, which is believed to be created by the
                    intelligence agencies of the United
                    States and Israel, that was originally aimed at targeting Iran’s nuclear program. This malware
                    attack targeted
                    programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used to automate industrial machine processes. The Stuxnet
                    worm reportedly
                    destroyed numerous centrifuges in Iran’s uranium enrichment facility by causing them to burn out and
                    self-destruct. This
                    worm attack traveled in USB sticks and would self-propagate on Windows Computers. It would search
                    for signs of Siemes’s
                    Step 7 software which was used by industrial systems using PLCs to monitor electro-mechanical
                    equipment. Once the Step 7
                    Software was found the worm would send bad instructions to the equipment and send faulty feedback to
                    the PLC so there
                    would be zero indication of dangerous operation until it began to self-destruct. Since the
                    development of Stuxnet many
                    different variants have arisen and still pose a threat to modern industrial operations far removed
                    from weapons,
                    military, or the government.</li>

                                addition to a secondary device. Security is increased since if one credential becomes

            <h2>Industry Standards for Cybersecurity</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some common standards regarding cybersecurity frameworks are the NIST and ISO/IEC. These frameworks play
                a critical role in ensuring that organizations
                have the necessary tools and guidance to protect themselves against cyber threats, while also promoting
                consistency and interoperability
                across different systems and sectors. Most companies adhere to and teach these standards in order to
                demonstrate to customers, partners, and other stakeholders
                that they are taking cybersecurity seriously and are committed to protecting their sensitive data and
                systems from cyber threats.
